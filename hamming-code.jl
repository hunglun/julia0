# Observation 2: the xor is often written as âŠ•, because it is equivalent to addition modulo 2.

# Observation 3
# Hamming 7 4 3 code, 7 is block length, 4 is the number of basis vectors, 3
# is the minimum distance.
# minimum distance 3
# maximum distance 7

# Concept of Relative distance
# The relative distance of a code is the minimum distance over block length 
# For example, the relative distance of hamming code is 3/7
